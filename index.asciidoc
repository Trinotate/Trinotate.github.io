.Trinotate Breaking News
========================
- March, 2016: Trinity V3.0 is released.  New features include:
- include custom protein database search results
- autoTrinotate script for automating all computations and loading the database.
- Kegg annotations are now reported.
- Make your own 'fresh' boilerplate database anytime, or use a pre-generated one. Your choice.
- Lighttpd webserver support for TrinotateWeb
- Boilerplate database is now tiny compared to previous versions.
- Uniprot/Trembl/Uniref90 not integrated directly, but searched as a custom database if desired.
========================


== Background ==

Trinotate is a comprehensive annotation suite designed for automatic functional annotation of transcriptomes, particularly de novo assembled transcriptomes, from model or non-model organisms. Trinotate makes use of a number of different well referenced methods for functional annotation including homology search to known sequence data (BLAST+/SwissProt), protein domain identification (HMMER/PFAM), protein signal peptide and transmembrane domain prediction (signalP/tmHMM), and leveraging various annotation databases (eggNOG/GO/Kegg databases). All functional annotation data derived from the analysis of transcripts is integrated into a SQLite database which allows fast efficient searching for terms with specific qualities related to a desired scientific hypothesis or a means to create a whole annotation report for a transcriptome.

Trinotate includes link:TrinotateWeb.html[TrinotateWeb], which provides a locally-driven web-based graphical interface for navigating transcriptome annotations and analyzing transcript expression and differential expression using the Trinity/RSEM/Bioconductor analysis framework.

== Software Required ==

- Trinotate
'http://trinotate.github.io' https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/releases[download Trinotate]


- Trinity (includes support for expression and DE analysis using RSEM and Bioconductor):
'http://trinityrnaseq.github.io/' https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/releases[download Trinity].
>Note, Trinity is not absolutely required.  It is possible to use Trinotate with other sources of transcript data as long as suitable inputs are available.


- TransDecoder for predicting coding regions in transcripts
'http://transdecoder.github.io' https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/releases[download TransDecoder].


- sqlite (required for database integration):
http://www.sqlite.org/

- NCBI BLAST+: Blast database Homology Search:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/

- HMMER/PFAM Protein Domain Identification:
http://hmmer.janelia.org/download.html

Below are optional but recommended:

- signalP v4 (free academic download)
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?signalp

  You should edit the following line to read like so, increasing the max number of entries that can be processed:
  my $MAX_ALLOWED_ENTRIES=2000000;  # default is only 2000

- tmhmm v2 (free academic download)
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?tmhmm

  You might need to edit the header lines of the scripts 'tmhmm' and 'tmhmmformat.pl' to read:
  #!/usr/bin/env perl

- RNAMMER (free academic download)
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/sw_request?rnammer

  Installation notes:
  RNAMMER requires the older version of hmmsearch (v2).  
  You can obtain the hmmsearch_v2 at ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/hmmer/2.3.2/hmmer-2.3.2.tar.gz[ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/hmmer/2.3.2/hmmer-2.3.2.tar.gz].
  After building the software, we suggest you rename this version of hmmsearch as 'hmmsearch2'.

  In the 'rnammer' software configuration, edit the rnammer script to point
  $HMMSEARCH_BINARY = "/path/to/hmmsearch2";

  Be sure that rnammer functions correctly by executing it on their provided sample data.  RNAMMER is quite useful, but the current implementation is not robust to error, so check carefully.


[[SequencesRequired]]
== Sequence Databases Required ==

Trinotate is *built around specific releases of SwissProt and Pfam*, and custom protein files are generated for use with Trinotate. *It is imperative* that these protein files are searched in order to maintain Trinotate compatibility; this is primarily because the UniprotKB identifiers are used as the protein accessions.  You can obtain the protein database files as the links below:

SwissProt
https://data.broadinstitute.org/Trinity/Trinotate_v3_RESOURCES/uniprot_sprot.pep.gz[Download SwissProt here]

    be sure the search database is uncompressed and properly formatted by running the following (requires that blast+ is already installed as indicated above)
    gunzip uniprot_sprot.pep.gz
    makeblastdb -in uniprot_sprot.pep -dbtype prot

Pfam domains
https://data.broadinstitute.org/Trinity/Trinotate_v3_RESOURCES/Pfam-A.hmm.gz[Download Pfam-A here]

   Uncompress and prepare it for use with 'hmmscan' like so:
   gunzip Pfam-A.hmm.gz
   hmmpress Pfam-A.hmm

[[SeqAnalyses]]
= Running Sequence Analyses =

Both the transcripts and any predicted protein-coding regions are subject to analysis using the various strategies below.

Trinity transcripts are searched for sequence homologies using BLASTX, and RNAMMER is used to identify potential rRNA transcripts.

Transdecoder-predicted coding regions are also searched for sequence homologies using BLASTP, protein domains identified via a Pfam search, and additional properties such as signal peptides and likely transmembrane-spanning regions are explored.


== Files needed for execution ==


- 'Trinity.fasta' - Final product containing all the transcripts assembled by Trinity

- 'Trinity.fasta.transdecoder.pep' - Most likely Longest-ORF peptide candidates generated from the Trinity Assembly. Instructions for generation of this file can be found here: http://transdecoder.github.io/[http://transdecoder.github.io/]


== Capturing BLAST Homologies ==

image::images/BLAST.png[Blast image]

BLAST information 
Instructions for installation of command line stand alone blast can be found here:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/ 
NOTE: This step will undoubtedly take the longest, for very large files execution on a multi-cpu server HPC environment is highly recommended, and your thread count should be equal to the number of CPU's present on the node the job is run on.


[width="100%",options="header"]
|======================================================================================================
| Blast Commands
|
| # search Trinity transcripts
| blastx -query Trinity.fasta -db uniprot_sprot.pep -num_threads 8 -max_target_seqs 1 -outfmt 6 > blastx.outfmt6
|
| # search Transdecoder-predicted proteins
|
| blastp -query transdecoder.pep -db uniprot_sprot.pep  -num_threads 8 -max_target_seqs 1 -outfmt 6 > blastp.outfmt6
|
|======================================================================================================

[ Note]
In addition to searching uniprot_sprot.pep, you can search any other protein database and load the results in as a custom protein database. Searching Swissprot, however, is critical to Trinotate, because that's where it retrieves the various Kegg, GO, and Eggnog, etc., annotations from.

Note: num_threads should be equal to the amount of cores available

[NOTE]
If you have access to a compute farm running LSF, SGE, PBS, or SLURM, consider using http://HpcGridRunner.github.io[HPC GridRunner] to maximally parallelize your blast searches.

== Running RNAMMER to identify rRNA transcripts ==

image::images/rnammer.png[RNAMMER image]

RNAMMER was originally developed to identify rRNA genes in genomic sequences.  To have it identify rRNA sequences among our large sets of transcriptome sequences, we first concatenate all the transcripts together into a single super-scaffold, run RNAMMER to identify rRNA homologies, and then transform the rRNA feature coordinates in the super-scaffold back to the transcriptome reference coordinates.  The following script will perform all of these operations:

  $TRINOTATE_HOME/util/rnammer_support/RnammerTranscriptome.pl 

 ################################################################################
 #
 #  --transcriptome <string>      Transcriptome assembly fasta file
 #
 #  --path_to_rnammer <string>    Path to the rnammer software 
 #                                (ie.  /usr/bin/software/rnammer_v1.2/rnammer)
 #
 #  Optional:
 # 
 #  --org_type <string>           arc|bac|euk   (default: euk)
 #
 ################################################################################


And so, you might execute it like so:

   $TRINOTATE_HOME/util/rnammer_support/RnammerTranscriptome.pl --transcriptome Trinity.fasta --path_to_rnammer /usr/bin/software/rnammer_v1.2/rnammer

Once complete, it will have generated a file: 'Trinity.fasta.rnammer.gff', which can be loaded into Trinotate as described in sections below.


[[LoadingSQLite]]
= Trinotate: Loading Above Results into a Trinotate SQLite Database =

The following commands will import the results from the bioinformatic computes performed above into a Trinotate SQLite database. All operations are performed using the included 'Trinotate' utility.  Usage is like so:



    usage: Trinotate <sqlite.db> <command> <input> [...]


     <commands>: 

         * Initial import of transcriptome and protein data:

             init --gene_trans_map <file> --transcript_fasta <file> --transdecoder_pep <file>

         * Transdecoder protein search results:

             LOAD_swissprot_blastp <file>
             LOAD_pfam <file>
             LOAD_tmhmm <file>
             LOAD_signalp <file>

          * Trinity transcript search results:

             LOAD_swissprot_blastx <file>
             LOAD_rnammer <file>
             

          * Load custom blast results using any searchable database


             LOAD_custom_blast --outfmt6 <file> --prog <blastp|blastx> --dbtype <database_name>


          * report generation:

             report [ -E (default: 1e-5) ] [--pfam_cutoff DNC|DGC|DTC|SNC|SGC|STC (default: DNC=domain noise cutoff)]





Follow the steps below to obtain a boilerplate Trinotate sqlite database and populate it with your data.


== Retrieve the Trinotate Pre-generated Resource SQLite database ==

A pregenerated sqlite database that contains Uniprot(swissprot and uniref90)-related annotation information is available from the Trinity ftp site. Pull it down like so:

   wget "https://data.broadinstitute.org/Trinity/Trinotate_v3_RESOURCES/Trinotate_v3.sqlite.gz" -O Trinotate.sqlite.gz


Uncompress it like so:

   gunzip Trinotate.sqlite.gz

[NOTE]
The boilerplate Trinotate.sqlite database downloaded above is specific to each software release.  The link above will retrieve the sqlite database that is compatible with this current software version (Trinotate v3).

[NOTE]
This boilerplate database comes with all annotation resources loaded into it, including swissprot record information, and will reflect the data that was available at the time of the build.   If for whatever reason you want to create your own boilerplate database based on the data available at current time, you can run the '$TRINOTATE_HOME/admin/Build_Trinotate_Boilerplate_SQLite_db.pl' script in a clean workspace, and it will pull down all the currently available data sets and build the boilerplate sqlite database based on their contents.


== Load transcripts and coding regions  ==

Begin populating the sqlite database by loading three data types:

- Transcript sequences (de novo assembled transcripts or reference transcripts)
- Protein sequences (currently as defined by TransDecoder)
- Gene/Transcript relationships (tab delimited format: "gene_id(tab)transcript_id", same as used by the RSEM software).  If you are using Trinity assemblies, you can generate this file like so: 

     $TRINITY_HOME/util/support_scripts/get_Trinity_gene_to_trans_map.pl Trinity.fasta >  Trinity.fasta.gene_trans_map

[NOTE]
If you're not using Trinity transcript assemblies, then it's up to you to provide the correspinding gene-to-transcript mapping file.

Load these info into the Trinotate sqlite database like so (example, using Trinity assemblies):

   Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite init --gene_trans_map Trinity.fasta.gene_trans_map --transcript_fasta Trinity.fasta --transdecoder_pep transdecoder.pep


== Loading BLAST homologies ==

 # load protein hits
 Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite LOAD_swissprot_blastp blastp.outfmt6

 # load transcript hits
 Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite LOAD_swissprot_blastx blastx.outfmt6

Optional: load custom database blast hits:

 # load protein hits
 Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite LOAD_custom_blast --outfmt6 custom_db.blastp.outfmt6 --prog blastp --dbtype custom_db_name

 # load transcript hits
 Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite LOAD_custom_blast --outfmt6 custom_db.blastx.outfmt6 --prog blastx --dbtype custom_db_name


== Load Pfam domain entries ==

 Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite LOAD_pfam TrinotatePFAM.out

== Load transmembrane domains ==

 Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite LOAD_tmhmm tmhmm.out

== Load signal peptide predictions ==

 Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite LOAD_signalp signalp.out

[[OutputReport]]
= Trinotate: Output an Annotation Report =

 Trinotate Trinotate.sqlite report [opts] > trinotate_annotation_report.xls

Note, you can threshold the blast and pfam results to be reported by including the options below:

 ##################################################################
 #
 #  -E <float>                 maximum E-value for reporting best blast hit
 #                             and associated annotations.
 #
 #  --pfam_cutoff <string>     'DNC' : domain noise cutoff (default)
 #                             'DGC' : domain gathering cutoff

The Trinity-assembled 18S/28S S. pombe rRNA region includes a TransDecoer predicted ORF with a blast match to an S. cerevisiae protein "Antisense to ribosomal RNA transcript protein 2 (ART2).

Backticks (\`) and carets (\^) are used as delimiters for data packed within an individual field, such as separating E-values, percent identity, and taxonomic info for best matches. When there are multiple assignments in a given field, the assignments are separated by (\`) and the fields within an assignment are separated by (\^).  In a future release (post Feb-2013), the backticks and carets will be used more uniformly than above, such as carets as BLAST field separators, and including more than the top hit.

[[SampleData]]
= Trinotate: Sample data and execution =

Sample data and a 'runMe.sh' script are available at $TRINOTATE_HOME/sample_data/

Executing the 'runMe.sh' script will pull down the Trinotate sqlite boilerplate database, populate with the provided bioinformatics computes, and generate the final Trinotate annotation report.  In addition, pre-computed expression and DE analyses will be loaded for use with TrinotateWeb.
