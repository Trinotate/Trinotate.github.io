TrinotateWeb: Graphical Interface for Navigating Trinotate Annotations and Expression Analyses
==============================================================================================

== Background ==

TrinotateWeb provides a web-based graphical interface to support local user-based navigation of Trinotate annotations and differential expression data. Simply run the included light-weight webserver, open your web browser and point it to your Trinotate SQLite database, and begin your data exploration.  Note, Trinotate is not yet a full-featured application, but is instead in a very early state of development. As an open source community-driven software development project, contributions are always welcome.

Trinotate makes extensive use of the http://canvasxpress.org[CanvasXpress] infrastructure, as developed and made publicly available by Isaac Neuhaus. "CanvasXpress was developed as the core visualization component for bioinformatics and systems biology analysis at Bristol-Myers Squibb" (http://canvasxpress.org/about.html[More about CanvasXpress]).

== TrinotateWeb Showcase ==

The current capabilities of TrinotateWeb are showcased below (note, the interface is continually improved across software releases):

== Populating Trinotate.sqlite with Expression Data ==

TrinotateWeb currently revolves around using the differential expression analysis pipeline supported by the Trinity suite, as described http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/#Downstream_analyses[here], specifically first generating abundance estimates using the http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/analysis/abundance_estimation.html[RSEM pipeline] and then performing the http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/analysis/diff_expression_analysis.html[DE analysis using Bioconductor].

After having run the above abundance estimation and DE analysis steps, you can begin loading the expression data like so:

  # import the fpkm and DE analysis stuff
  $TRINOTATE_HOME/util/transcript_expression/import_expression_and_DE_results.pl --sqlite Trinotate.sqlite \
                                                                   --samples_file samples_n_reads_described.txt \
                                                                   --count_matrix Trinity_trans.counts.matrix \
                                                                   --fpkm_matrix Trinity_trans.counts.matrix.TMM_normalized.FPKM \
                                                                   --DE_dir edgeR_trans/ \
                                                                   --transcript_mode
[NOTE]
The above is based on using the transcript-level abundance estimates and corresponding DE analyses.  Abundance estimation and DE analysis can be performed at the 'gene' level as well.  Optionally, run the above using '--component_mode' (gene mode) with the corresponding gene-based files.  Both transcript-level and gene-level data can be loaded into the single Trinotate.sqlite instance for analysis.

== Populate Trinotate.sqlite with Transcript Expression Clusters ==

The Trinity analysis framework describes methods for clustering transcripts based on related expression patterns http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/analysis/diff_expression_analysis.html[here].  After defining clusters, load these into the Trinotate.sqlite database like so:

  # import transcript clusters
  $TRINOTATE_HOME/util/transcript_expression/import_transcript_clusters.pl \
       --group_name edgeR_DE_analysis \
       --analysis_name edgeR_trans/diffExpr.P0.001_C2.matrix.R.all.RData.clusters_fixed_P_20 \
       --sqlite Trinotate.sqlite \
       edgeR_trans/diffExpr.P0.001_C2.matrix.R.all.RData.clusters_fixed_P_20/*matrix

The step of defining expression clusters can be run multiple times using different parameters according to the http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/analysis/diff_expression_analysis.html[Trinity documentation].  Each set of clusters can be loaded in separately as above and then separately studied within TrinotateWeb.


== Populate Trinotate.sqlite with Annotation Text ==

Any free-text annotation can be applied to your input transcripts, and these data can then be queried by text searches within TrinotateWeb.  This was the simplest way to get text-searching up and running in a flexible way, and more sophisticated methods for querying the data will be included in future releases.  If you've used Trinotate to generate annotations (ex. generated the Trinotate_report.xls tab-delimited summary data file), you can simply import that data table back into Trinotate as the textual annotation for the transcripts (Highly Recommended).  Alternatively, if you have a file containing a tab delimited format of:

    gene_id (tab) transcript_id (tab) annotation text

you can use that file instead.  Just realize that the TrinotateWeb text-querying is currently soley based on this 'annotation text'.  Load the annotations into the Trinotate.sqlite database like so:

   # Load annotations
   $TRINOTATE_HOME/util/annotation_importer/import_transcript_names.pl Trinotate.sqlite Trinotate_report.xls


== Sample data ==

A full set of sample data for loading a Trinotate.sqlite database and populating it with expression and annotation data according to the above steps is provided at

  $TRINOTATE_HOME/sample_data/

Simply './runMe.sh' in that directory to generate the fully populated 'Trinotate.sqlite' database that's ready for exploration using TrinotateWeb.

== Running TrinotateWeb ==

To run TrinotateWeb, you'll need a light-weight webserver installed. We recommend using http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml[mongoose], which is free and easy to obtain for Linux.  For installation on Mac, I found it's easiest to use http://brew.sh/[homebrew] and install via 'brew install mongoose'.

   cd $TRINOTATE_HOME/TrinotateWeb/

   ./run_mongoose_webserver.sh 

and leave it running within your terminal window.  To stop it, type cntrl-C or exit the terminal.

Then, go to your web browser and visit the URL:  'http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/index.cgi'

You should be prompted to enter in the path to your Trinotate sqlite database.

== Navigating TrinotateWeb ==

=== Overview Tab ===

The overview tab will show basic summary statistics.

=== Differential Expression Analysis ===

Differential expression can be explored from interactive volcano plots, MA plots, and heatmaps, starting from the 'Differential Expression' tab.

An example volcano plot for a pairwise comparison between two samples is shown below:

image::images/TrinotateVolcano.png["Trinotate Volcano Plot page", width=500]

Just double-click on a point to visit that gene or transcript's expression and annotation report.  Drag and select a range to zoom in.

=== Gene/Transcript ID or Keyword Searches ===

==== Keyword Search ====

You can search for genes or transcripts via keyword searches.  For example, from the keyword search tab, I type in 'transporter' like so:

image::images/TrinotateKeywordSelectionInput.png["Trinotate keyword search entry", width=500]

Submitting the search results in a list of all entries where 'transporter' was found among the annotation text.

==== Gene/Transcript ID Search ====

Given a gene or transcript identifier, the feature can be searched for directly via the 'Gene or Transcript ID Search' tab:

=== Gene/Transcript Expression and Annotation Reports ===

A given gene or transcript search will lead to a gene/transcript expression and annotation report page:

Annotation information will be displayed below, including a view of the position of the ORF on the transcript and any homology match information.
